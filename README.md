Sonixd is a cross-platform desktop client built for Subsonic-API compatible music servers. This project was inspired by the many existing clients, but aimed to address a few key issues including <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>library management</strong>, and <strong>user experience</strong>.

- [**Usage documentation & FAQ**](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/15)
- [**Theming documentation**](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd/discussions/61)

The application is successfully tested on the following servers: [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome), [Airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic), [Airsonic-Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced), [Supysonic](https://github.com/spl0k/supysonic), [Gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic), [Astiga](https://asti.ga/)

## Features

- HTML5 audio with crossfading and gapless\* playback
- Drag and drop rows with multi-select
- Modify and save playlists intuitively
- Handles large playlists and queues
- Global mediakeys support
- Multi-theme support
- Supports all Subsonic API compatible servers targeting v1.15.0
- Built with Electron, React with the [rsuite v4](https://github.com/rsuite/rsuite) component library

<h5>* Gapless playback is artifically created using the crossfading players so it may not be perfect, YMMV.</h5>
